This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Dockerfiles related to package management and entrypoint specification. The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) uses `apt-get update` without a subsequent `apt-get upgrade`, potentially leading to outdated packages and build inconsistencies. The `CMD` instruction might also fail if the entrypoint script's location differs from what's specified.

The corrected Dockerfile (`DockerfileFixed`) addresses these issues by including `apt-get upgrade`, ensuring that the system is up-to-date with the latest packages, and using a more robust `CMD` command.
